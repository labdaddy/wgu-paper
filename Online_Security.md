MONSTERS UNDER THE BED, THE DANGER OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING
##### SPEECH TOPIC: ONLINE SECURITY - SOCIAL ENGINEERING Points to make: dangers of social engineering hacks (phishing, watering hole, whaling, pretexting, baiting and tailgating)

(INTENDED AUDIENCE)

The intended audience for this presentation is internet users in the US corporate workplace. This group of people use the internet casually but are not directly involved in information security and are not aware of the dangers presented by bad actors online. 

(IMPORTANCE STATEMENT)

The need for education on the basics of information security is very real. Many people do not have any idea how to keep themselves safe online and numerous bad actors are trying to steal sensitive, confidential information from wherever they can to use for personal gain. 
Workers in US corporations have frequent access to very sensitive, confidential information such as financial, medical and other personally identifieble data for virtually everyone in the country. When exposed in data breaches this information can materially harm innocent people. 
To put into perspective the extraordinary cost of information security failures; the annual report from Cybersecurity Ventures research arm in combination with global managed security services provider Herjavec Group (Cybersecurity Ventures 08/26/2016, 10/16/2017 and 12/07/2018) predict that the global cost of cyber crime damages in 2021 will be $6 trillion ! 

PRESENTATION PLAN

(ATTENTION GETTING OPENING)

Someone is trying to steal your personal information ! Social engineering threats are everywhere online and offline. The range of potential attacks is staggering and not being aware of some of the more common attack vectors leaves most people completely vulnerable. 

(THESIS STATEMENT)

Information security research suggests that social engineering attacks are extremely effective because people are naturally trusting (phishing/ quid pro quo) and because people do not take security seriously.(find data to support this)

(PREVIEW OF MAIN POINTS)

Today I am going to talk about two main points that show why social engineering attacks are so effective, these are:
1. People are trusting
2. People do not take security seriously

(MAIN POINT ONE WITH THREE SUB POINTS)

People are trusting.
Phishing 
One of the most common social engineering attacks is called phishing. Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that has been in use for decades and remains popular because gullible workers still fall for this type of attack.
Halon, a technology leader in email security, announced the results of its U.S. survey ‘Email Spam and Related User Behavior’. Conducted by market research group TNS Global, the survey discovered that 94.7 percent of Americans received at least one email containing a virus, spyware, or malware. About one in eleven (8.8%) opened the attachment and infected their computer. Almost a third (30.2%) came dangerously close to doing the same, opening the email but stopping short of opening the attachment. These spam emails bogusly claim to come most often from banking institutions (15.9%), social media sites like Facebook or Twitter (15.2%), and online payment services (12.8%).(Halon Security Inc, 08/27/2013)
This survey shows how very susceptible people are and how easily an attacker can make it past even the most robust, sophisticated network security. Everyone gets email. Its that easy. And educating workers about a simple, easily avoided activity can prevent a data breach that might take down the corporate network, destroy equipment or even worse, reveal confidential user data to the world.
An example of the cost of successful phishing attacks is the FBI dubbed Operation Phish Phry.
In 2009, the FBI called Operation Phish Phry the largest international phishing case ever conducted. Hundreds of bank and credit card customers received official-looking emails directing them towards fake financial websites. Victims entered their account numbers and passwords into fraudulent forms, giving the attackers easy access to their private data.
The team behind the scam was highly organized. Then-director of the FBI, Robert Mueller used it as an example of how large organized crime syndicates are indiscernible from nation-state actors when it comes to ambitious, large-scale cyberattacks. There is just no way to know who the perpetrator really is until after the investigation.
The operation was relatively simple by today’s standards, but managed to steal about $15 million from hundreds or even thousands of bank accounts.
A multinational team of US based and Egyptian hackers coordinated this large-scale project. The FBI ultimately charged more than 100 individuals, relying on cooperation from Egyptian national security agents to capture nearly half of them outside United States’ territory. 47 people were convicted in a Los Angeles Federal court. (Forbes Magazine, May 15th, 2012)

Quid pro quo.
A quid pro quo attack promises a service or a benefit based on the execution of a specific action. In a quid pro quo attack scenario, the hacker offers a service or benefit in exchange for information or access.
Fake security or IT personnel contact random individuals, inform them that there’s been a computer problem on their end and ask that those individuals confirm their login crededtials or often even more 
The most common quid pro quo attack occurs when a hacker impersonates an IT staffer for a large organization. That hacker attempts to contact via phone the employees of the target organization then offers them some kind of upgrade or software installation.
They might request victims to facilitate the operation by disabling the AV software temporarily to install the malicious application.



(MAIN POINT TWO WITH THREE SUB POINTS)

People do not take security seriously. 


(restatement of thesis)


MATERIAL BELOW IS POSSIBLY USEABLE
EXAMPLE: The following example illustrates the thesis with the preview (in italics): “New York Fashion Week is an exciting event that many of us have heard about and during which designers reveal the upcoming season’s collection to fashion journalists and retail buyers, and in my speech, I will explain the event and share my experiences as an attendee. First I will present the event’s history, then I will preview the fashions on display and finally I will describe for you what to expect should you attend the week.”
This clearly illustrates the need for further education on the dangers of social engineering attacks through the medium of email. In addition there is the common approach of quid pro quo social engineering attacks where an attacker poses as an authority figure or technical representative that can be trusted with sensitive or confidential information.
This paper is focused on the dangers of social engineering attacks. Studies show that 30 percent of individuals would open an email even if they were aware it was suspicous. This type of attack typically involves some form of psychological manipulation, exploiting weaknesses in human logic known as cognitive biases. NEEDS MORE

RESTATEMENT OF THESIS

SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS

CLOSING COMMENTS

[Since this applies to most people there is an enormous attack surface exposed to bad actors on the internet. The fact that most people are not aware of the risks posed by insecure internet usage leaves confidential information vulnerable to many types of attacks. Everyone has personal, confidential data that is being stored online, whether that is through housing records, medical records, driving or insurance records, school records or any other of dozens of types of records. The lack of proper awareness and training for most people who use the internet means that the sensitive and confidential personal data of every person in the world is at risk.}     



Major claim: Social engineering is very effective and therefore very dangerous
Main point 1: social engineering is commonly implemented through phishing 
Main point 2: social engineering is also commonly implemented through quid pro quo 


PHISHING
This is a type of attack in which a message or email would redirect the victim to a legitimate-appearing site and would ask for personal identification information.
The message would reflect a sense of urgency and test an individual’s excellent knowledge in judging information in the extreme environment.


QUID PRO QUO
This is a hybrid version of the others. The attacker would offer assistance and pretend to be a technical expert when the victim is facing technical issues. The attacker would ask the victim to install malware in one way or the other.


Defense in depth/ Risk mitigation

Security Policy: A well written policy should
include technical and nontechnical approaches that
are downward driven by executive management.
Every organization should integrate security into
their operational objectives.
Education and Training: Employees ought to be
required to attend initial training during orientation
and recurring refresher trainings.
This builds
awareness by exposing users to commonly employed
tactics and behaviors targeted by a social engineer.
