ONSTERS UNDER THE BED, THE IMPORTANCE OF ONLINE SECURITY IN THE WORKPLACE
##### SPEECH TOPIC: ONLINE SECURITY - SOCIAL ENGINEERING Points to make: dangers of social engineering hacks (phishing, watering hole, whaling, pretexting, baiting and tailgating)

(INTENDED AUDIENCE)
The intended audience for this presentation is internet users in the US corporate workplace. This group of people use the internet casually but are not directly involved in information security and are not aware of the dangers presented by bad actors online. 

(IMPORTANCE STATEMENT)
Workers in US corporations have frequent access to very sensitive, confidential information such as financial, medical and other personally identifieble data for virtually everyone in the country. When exposed in data breaches this information can materially harm innocent people. 

PRESENTATION PLAN

INTRODUCTION (opening statement, thesis, preview of main points)


[Since this applies to most people there is an enormous attack surface exposed to bad actors on the internet. The fact that most people are not aware of the risks posed by insecure internet usage leaves confidential information vulnerable to many types of attacks. Everyone has personal, confidential data that is being stored online, whether that is through housing records, medical records, driving or insurance records, school records or any other of dozens of types of records. The lack of proper awareness and training for most people who use the internet means that the sensitive and confidential personal data of every person in the world is at risk.}     

(ATTENTION GRABBING OPENING)
Someone is trying to steal your information ! Because the majority of people do not have any idea how to protect themselves online 
The need for education on the basics of information security is very real. Many people do not have any idea how to keep themselves safe online and numerous bad actors are trying to steal sensitive, confidential information from wherever they can to use for personal gain. Threats are everywhere online and offline. The range of potential attacks is staggering and not being aware of some of the more common attack vectors leaves most people completely vulnerable. This paper is focused on the dangers of social engineering attacks. Studies show that 30 percent of individuals would open an email even if they were aware it was suspicous. This type of attack typically involves some form of psychological manipulation, exploiting weaknesses in human logic known as cognitive biases. NEEDS MORE

(GENERAL PURPOSE STATEMENT, identify if informative or persuasive in nature)
The purpose of my presentation is to inform my audience about the dangers of social engineering attacks on typical internet users.

(THESIS STATEMENT)
Information security research suggests that social engineering attacks are extremely effective because (a) people are trusting (phishing/ quid pro quo) and (b) because people do not take security seriously.(find data to support this)

(PREVIEW OF MAIN POINTS) [needs re-writing]
EXAMPLE: The following example illustrates the thesis with the preview (in italics): “New York Fashion Week is an exciting event that many of us have heard about and during which designers reveal the upcoming season’s collection to fashion journalists and retail buyers, and in my speech, I will explain the event and share my experiences as an attendee. First I will present the event’s history, then I will preview the fashions on display and finally I will describe for you what to expect should you attend the week.”
This clearly illustrates the need for further education on the dangers of social engineering attacks through the medium of email. In addition there is the common approach of quid pro quo social engineering attacks where an attacker poses as an authority figure or technical representative that can be trusted with sensitive or confidential information.

(MAIN POINT ONE WITH THREE SUB POINTS)
Phishing
Phishing email method of social engineering attacks and quid pro quo method of social engineering attacks.
The common phishing email method is a type of attack in which a message or email would redirect the victim to a legitimate-appearing site and would ask for personal identification information.
The message would reflect a sense of urgency and test an individual’s excellent knowledge in judging information in the extreme environment.

(MAIN POINT TWO WITH THREE SUB POINTS)
Quid pro quo.
This is a sophisticated method of attck is a hybrid version of other common methods. The attacker would offer assistance and pretend to be, for example, a technical expert when the victim is facing technical issues. The attacker would ask the victim to install malware in one way or the other or convince the victim to provide login credentials.

(SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS)

(CLOSING COMMENTS)


STRUCTURE SUGGESTIONS
Remove discussion around company related training, see if 5 minutes can be met without this discussion. It makes the content less clear and will introduce the requirement for additional supporting documents.




Major claim: Social engineering is very effective and therefore very dangerous
Main point 1: social engineering is commonly implemented through phishing 
Main point 2: social engineering is also commonly implemented through quid pro quo 


PHISHING
This is a type of attack in which a message or email would redirect the victim to a legitimate-appearing site and would ask for personal identification information.
The message would reflect a sense of urgency and test an individual’s excellent knowledge in judging information in the extreme environment.


QUID PRO QUO
This is a hybrid version of the others. The attacker would offer assistance and pretend to be a technical expert when the victim is facing technical issues. The attacker would ask the victim to install malware in one way or the other.


Defense in depth/ Risk mitigation

Security Policy: A well written policy should
include technical and nontechnical approaches that
are downward driven by executive management.
Every organization should integrate security into
their operational objectives.
Education and Training: Employees ought to be
required to attend initial training during orientation
and recurring refresher trainings.
This builds
awareness by exposing users to commonly employed
tactics and behaviors targeted by a social engineer.
