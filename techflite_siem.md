#### TechFlite SIEM

A.  Organizational Need
Summarize an organizational need in the case study, including the scope of the need:

TechFite has a strong organizational need for a centralized method of providing the needed network security, log analysis and FISMA compliance. Without the ability to secure the network, accurately analyze our log adate and achieve FISMA compliance we risk future revenue to the company. The system administrators are so busy keeping up with the technology they have that they will not have time to research new technologies that might help them do their jobs better. For all of these reasons the SolarWinds SIEM product is the perfect solution. It combines a security IDS for the network, automated threat collection, a dashboard for easy analysis of log data and it is NIST FISMA compliant.

B. Emerging Technology Solution

	Propose an emerging technology solution to address the organizational need from the case study. Provide justification that classifies this technology as emerging. 

C:  Adoption process

	Outline an adoption process for the technology solution you plan to implement, using the risks and benefits of early adoption versus the risks and benefits of later adoption to justify your adoption timing. 
	
D: Technology Impact

	Describe potential positive and negative effects your technology solution could have on the people and current processes in the organization, providing examples for how to address any negative effects. 

E: Technology Comparison

	Compare your technology solution to similar existing technology solutions, including details that qualify how your chosen technology better supports the organization’s mission, goals, and vision. 

F: Adoption Metrics

	Propose methods for measuring the impact of the technology, including specific metrics that would support whether the adoption is successful or unsuccessful. 

G: Sources

	Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
