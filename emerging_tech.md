A.  Organizational Need
Summarize an organizational need in the case study, including the scope of the need:
TechFite has a strong organizational need for a centralized method of providing the needed network security, log analysis and FISMA compliance. Without the ability to secure the network, accurately analyze our log data and achieve FISMA compliance we risk the future revenue of the company. The system administrators are so busy keeping up with the technology they have they will not have time to research new technologies that might help them do their jobs better. This means TechFite has a very strong need for an affordable, user friendly, multi solution product.




B. Emerging Technology Solution
	Propose an emerging technology solution to address the organizational need from the case study. Provide justification that classifies this technology as emerging. 
	For all of the reasons outlined above the SolarWinds SIEM product is the perfect solution. It combines out-of-the-box use, a security IDS for the network, automated threat collection, a dashboard for easy analysis of log data and it is NIST FISMA compliant.

C:  Adoption process
	Outline an adoption process for the technology solution you plan to implement, using the risks and benefits of early adoption versus the risks and benefits of later adoption to justify your adoption timing.
	
	 
	
D: Technology Impact
	Describe potential positive and negative effects your technology solution could have on the people and current processes in the organization, providing examples for how to address any negative effects. 
	The potential positive impacts of this technology solution on the people and current processes in the organization are:
	1. Improved security: The SolarWinds product includes an intrusion detection system (IDS) that has out of the box pre-configuration to detect hundreds of typical online threats.
	2. Log analysis: The Solarwinds product includes a user friendly dashboard for viewing collected logs and pulling useful data from them
	3. FISMA compliance: The product also includes affordable add on functionality to meet NIST/ FISMA compliance
	4. User Friendly: The SolarWinds product is very user friendly so the system administrators can get up and running with this solution and not detract from their other duties.

E: Technology Comparison
	Compare your technology solution to similar existing technology solutions, including details that qualify how your chosen technology better supports the organization’s mission, goals, and vision. 

F: Adoption Metrics
	Propose methods for measuring the impact of the technology, including specific metrics that would support whether the adoption is successful or unsuccessful. 

G: Sources
	Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized. 


Possible solutions: 
SolarWinds SIEM can provide the needed network security, log analysis and even FISMA compliance

Issues that can be solved for this paper:
1. Network security
2. Log Storage
3. Log analysis (real time, data gathering etc)
4. FISMA compliance
