A. Organizational Need Summarize an organizational need in the case study, including the scope of the need:

TechFite has a strong organizational need for a centralized method of providing the needed network security, log analysis and FISMA compliance. Without the ability to secure the network, accurately analyze our log data and achieve FISMA compliance we risk the future revenue of the company. The system administrators are so busy keeping up with the technology they have they will not have time to research new technologies that might help them do their jobs better. This means TechFite has a very strong need for an affordable, user friendly, multi solution product.

B. Emerging Technology Solution

Propose an emerging technology solution to address the organizational need from the case study. Provide justification that classifies this technology as emerging. 

For all of the reasons outlined above the SolarWinds SIEM product is the perfect solution. It combines out-of-the-box use, a security IDS for the network, automated threat collection, a dashboard for easy analysis of log data and it is NIST FISMA compliant. At a stroke, this single product solves several key issues facing the TechFite and it does so in an affordable, user friendly manner.

C. Adoption process

Outline an adoption process for the technology solution you plan to implement, using the risks and benefits of early adoption versus the risks and benefits of later adoption to justify your adoption timing.

SCOPE: 

The business focus and context for this emerging technology adoption are the critical business functions of (1) medical device manufacture and (2) maintaining a secure network to protect TechFite's propietary technology that allows humans to work longer in space. 
As the organization is not aggressive with respect to adopting emerging technologies, the SolarWinds product offers a great solution to several core issues that support the critical business functions without requiring any additional investment in training, equipment or risk.
The scope of use for this platform is to provide an optimal solution to TechFite's numerous pressing issues. The optimal solution will offer the best combination of the following (5) factors:
1. Cost
2. Ease of use and deployment
3. Network security 
4. Log analysis
5. FISMA compliance
The factor of cost is to be weighted most heavily as TechFite is not in the financial condition to accomodate either large upfront costs or any significant unexpected costs during deployment of the SIEM platform.
The factor of ease of use is to be weighted next most heavily as the system administrators tasked with deploying and maintaining the platform do not have the time to perform research or training to deploy the product. Again, the factor of cost becomes a primary component in the decision as the system administrators time is most valuably spent supporting existing revenue generating activities.

TRACK: 

Review of many SIEM offerings in the security space through such sources as the highly respected Gartner, global research and advisory firm, have indicated that there are several SIEM solutions that should be considered for application to TechFite's numerous pressing issues.
The position of the platforms below in their respective maturity cycle and suite of solutions offered is sufficient to support their inclusion in the review. 
The relevant technologies for solving these several important business issues are: 
IBM Security, Splunk, Logpoint, SolarWinds. 

RANK:

The candidates selected for the review and comparison are IBM Security, Splunk, Logpoint and SolarWinds. The selection criteria are those mentioned above, where the platform will offer the optimal combination of cost, ease of use and deployment, network security, log analysis and FISMA compliance. 
Of the selected SIEM platforms the IBM and SolarWinds platforms appear to have the best practical application to the immediate needs of TechFite. The pricing model of the IBM platform may be to cumbersome but additional review will determine the effect this has on the value offered by the platform.

EVALUATE:

The services included with both the IBM Security and Splunk options are excellent and they are the market leaders in SIEM products. However the convenience and maturity thes platforms provide come at a hefty cost. The pricing model for both of these products is complex with many services and is based on two components that scale rapidly with use.
1. Data throughput. The SIEM logs data packet volume and the customer is billed according to the total volume of data packets that pass through the observability layer of the platform. This method of billing offers no protection from spikes in usage caused by third parties. TechFite works with third parties frequently and this unknown is a highly concerning issue.
2. Accessing any services beyond the very basic core suite requires additional subscription costs. While both platforms are robust and mature, actually utilizing the benefits of the platform maturity is associated with significant additional cost. These costs are likely to spiral up rapidly and as a small company TechFite is not in the position to accomodate these type of costly unknowns. Neither of these solutions is recommended.

The services included with both the Logpoint and Solarwinds platforms are clear, practical pricing model based on connected devices. The volume of data throughput does not factor into the cost model. This is a huge benefit to companies the size of TechFite and practically speaking, is the most important consideration. In addition to the much friendlier price model, these two platforms solve several pressing issues facing TechFite, namely: network security, log analysis and FISMA compliance. The benefits of good pricing and 
muliple solutions is a powerful combination that puts TechFite in a strong position to succeed in the market place. Of the two platforms, the LogPoint SIEM lacks a clear cut product strategy with a reliance on customers possesing specialized programming knowledge to make use of the platform interfaces. In addition the log analysis solution requires software plug-ins that again, require specialized software knowledge to make full use of. 


EVANGELIZE:
After the review and comparison, the IBM Security, Splunk and LogPoint SIEM platforms have been identified as having problems that are not compatible with the needs of TechFite. 
The SolarWinds platform combines solutions to multiple issues plaguing TechFite, a simplified pricing model, a robust peer community for assistance with deployments and operation, network security features, log analysis and FISMA compliance. This platform is the clear winner and the best solution for TechFite.


TRANSFER:

The transfer of this recommended platform will be the adoption of its use by the system administrators whose responsibilities will include deployment and maintenance of the SIEM platform as well as analysis of logs collected and preparation of the date for FISMA compliance.

D. Technology Impact
