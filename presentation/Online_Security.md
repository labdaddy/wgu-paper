MONSTERS UNDER THE BED, THE DANGER OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING
##### SPEECH TOPIC: ONLINE SECURITY - SOCIAL ENGINEERING Points to make: dangers of social engineering hacks (phishing, watering hole, whaling, pretexting, baiting and tailgating)

(INTENDED AUDIENCE)

The intended audience for this presentation is internet users in the US corporate workplace. This group of people use the internet casually but are not directly involved in information security and are not aware of the dangers presented by bad actors online. 

(IMPORTANCE STATEMENT)

The need for education on the basics of information security is very real. Many people do not have any idea how to keep themselves safe online and numerous bad actors are trying to steal sensitive, confidential information from wherever they can to use for personal gain. 
Workers in US corporations have frequent access to very sensitive, confidential information such as financial, medical and other personally identifieble data for virtually everyone in the country. When exposed in data breaches this information can materially harm innocent people. 
To put into perspective the extraordinary cost of information security failures; the annual report from Cybersecurity Ventures research arm in combination with global managed security services provider Herjavec Group  predict that the global cost of cyber crime damages in 2021 will be $6 trillion !

PRESENTATION PLAN

(ATTENTION GETTING OPENING)
Someone is trying to steal your personal information ! Social engineering threats are everywhere online and offline. The range of potential attacks is staggering and not being aware of some of the more common attack vectors leaves most corporate employees completely vulnerable. 

(THESIS STATEMENT)
Information security research concludes that social engineering attacks are extremely effective because people are naturally trusting and because people do not take security seriously.

(PREVIEW OF MAIN POINTS)
Today I am going to talk about two main points that show why social engineering attacks are so effective, these are:
1. People are trusting
2. People do not take security seriously

(MAIN POINT ONE WITH THREE SUB POINTS)
People are trusting.
Phishing 
One of the most common social engineering attacks is called phishing. Phishing has been in use for decades and remains popular because gullible workers still fall for this type of attack.
Halon, a technology leader in email security, announced the results of its U.S. survey ‘Email Spam and Related User Behavior’. Conducted by market research group TNS Global, the survey discovered that 94.7 percent of Americans received at least one email containing a virus, spyware, or malware. About one in eleven (8.8%) opened the attachment and infected their computer. Almost a third (30.2%) came dangerously close to doing the same, opening the email but stopping short of opening the attachment. These spam emails bogusly claim to come most often from banking institutions (15.9%), social media sites like Facebook or Twitter (15.2%), and online payment services (12.8%).(Halon Security Inc, 08/27/2013)
This survey shows how susceptible people are and how easily an attacker can make it past even the most robust, sophisticated network security. 
Everyone gets email. Its that easy. 
Educating workers about a simple, easily avoided activity can prevent a data breach that might take down the corporate network, destroy equipment or even worse, reveal confidential user data to the world.
An example of the cost of successful phishing attacks is the FBI dubbed Operation Phish Phry.
In 2009, the FBI called Operation Phish Phry the largest international phishing case ever conducted. Hundreds of bank and credit card customers received official-looking emails directing them towards fake financial websites. Victims entered their account numbers and passwords into fraudulent forms, giving the attackers easy access to their private data.
The team behind the scam was highly organized. Then-director of the FBI, Robert Mueller used it as an example of how large organized crime syndicates are indiscernible from nation-state actors when it comes to ambitious, large-scale cyberattacks. There is just no way to know who the perpetrator really is until after the investigation.
The operation was relatively simple by today’s standards, but managed to steal about $15 million from hundreds or even thousands of bank accounts.
A multinational team of US based and Egyptian hackers coordinated this large-scale project. The FBI ultimately charged more than 100 individuals, relying on cooperation from Egyptian national security agents to capture nearly half of them outside United States’ territory. 47 people were convicted in a Los Angeles Federal court.

Spear phishing
Spear phising attacks are a specialized sub set of regular phishing attacks. In spear phishing the attack is targeted for a specific individual. The hacker will identify the target, perform research and then send a carefully crafted and personalized email that looks legitimate. The victim opens the email which introduces malware into the target network. The malware can either steal or destroy date directly or provide remote access for the attacker. 
In 2015 teenage UK based hacker Kane Gamble successfully spear fished the email account of the deputy director of the CIA and other security officials. The directors email account with Verizon was part of the hackers targeted spearfishing campaign that resulted in full account access. The hacker forwarded numerous emails to the free palestine movement. (SecurityAffairs.co, 10/20/2015, SecurityAffairs.co, 04/21/2018)



(MAIN POINT TWO WITH THREE SUB POINTS)
People do not take security seriously. 

Quid pro quo.
Quid pro quo attacks are a category of social engineering attacks wherein the attacker poses as someone in the internal IT department in order to gain access to and compromise a users computer. Once the attacker has access to the physical machine on the network it is easy to move laterally throughout the organizations subnets and wreak havoc on internal systems.
Quid pro quo attacks are effective because people assume that if someone says they are from the IT department it is safe to interact with this person. 
This type of attack promises a service or a benefit based on the execution of a specific action. Fake security or IT personnel contact individuals in the target organization, inform them that there’s been a computer problem on their end and ask that those individuals to provide confidential information like confirming their login credentials or a multi factor authentication code.
As with other social engineering schemes, Quid Pro Quo is best prevented by ensuring that employees are aware of this tactic and trained on an appropriate response.  Corporate teams should hold ongoing discussions about which company information is appropriate to share and in which scenarios.  An employee should never divulge sensitive information unless the employee initiated the exchange.  If an outside caller initiated the exchange, the employee would be wise to call this person back at the phone number on the caller’s company website.

No security in the C-suite
The United Kingdom's digital media department released a report in 2019 called the Cybersecurity Breaches Survey. (UK government, Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2019, Department for Digital culture, media and sport)
One of the worrying trends outlined in this report is the fact that only 35% of companies have a board member with specific security related responsibilites. Even among large companies more than 40 percent did not have a board member with a specific security responsibility.

No security plan in place.
Even though nearly one third of the surveyed respondents (32%) had experienced a data breach or other cyber attack in the previous twelve months, few businesses are taking the time to create an incident response plan. 
With so few companies having created a formal response plan to a cyber security event, they are left in a very dangerous position. With the likelihood of a security incident so high there is a huge disconnect between the need for responsible security measures and their implementation. (UK government, Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2019, Department for Digital culture, media and sport)

(restatement of thesis)
As we have seen, the effectiveness and therefore the danger, of social engineering attacks are due largely to most corporate employees trusting natures and a general lack of willingness to take security measures seriously at all levels of business.

During this presentation I talked about the following points:
Social engineering attacks are effective because people tend to be too trusting of external emails, IT staff or anyone in a position of a technical nature.
And that people do not take the full measure of risk involved in lax security procedures including not having a security focused culture from the top down and not being prepared with a written plan to deal with a security incident.

It is my sincere belief that unless and until the corporate culture changes to accept the responsibility of training employees in security best practices, including a security focus from the top down and preparing for a data breach or other attack, the current trend of breach after breach will continue. I think that a minimum change to the typical business approach to security mindset should be:
1. Ongoing training in security best practices, i.e. not opening emails from unknown senders, not following suspect links to dangerous websites, not sharing login credentials with anyone
2. Member of the C-suite with a security mandate and the authority to enforce it
3. A corporate culture that embraces security preparation with security integrated into their operational objectives
4. Clear, direct documentation on steps to follow in the event of a data breach or other security incident (Incident response plan)
